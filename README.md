# LearnToCode
My journey to Learning to Code

It's been a over 10 years since I fell in love with the startup work. I was working on cruise ships and had very very little internet access. Had a series of false starts of learning to code. 

## 2010 - Excel VBA
- Googled everyday for a couple years. Built an excel sheet system to manage digital content across a network of 80 touch screens on Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines.
## 2014 - Google Script
- Googled everyday for 5 years. Built the operations and data store for The QYOU television networks in Google sheets with Google Script
## 2017 - mySQL
- Conceived, Hired, and Managed the buildling of an internal database using mySQL and PHP. I personally created the data schema and mySQL for the backend of the project. Hired and Managed a PHP developer to build the front end.
## 2018 - Javascript
- Built [Influence.Directory](http://influence.directory/), and learned Javascript to add search functionality for [Influencer Marketing Agencies database](http://influence.directory/agencies)
## 2020 - Launched Better Sheets
